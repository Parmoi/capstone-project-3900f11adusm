Week 1

Group formed and named. Made note of memberâ€™s area of expertise and chose a
scrum master (Uguudei). Decided on top 3 project preferences and sent them to
the tutor. Scrum master created Jira Site. Scheduled async stand-ups for end of
week, and a meeting on Monday.

Week 2

Cancelled meeting on Monday because we didn't get the project preference back
yet. Received project confirmation on Tuesday (p20). Group discussed project
during our Friday lab. Wrote down all functionality we want for collectors,
and decided on tasks for our first sprint and MVP. Decided on the product lead
(me). Greg joined our group. Assigned tasks to everyone to be done by our next
meeting on Monday. Team leads of p20 set up a QA session with the product owner
for Monday 6pm.

Week 3

Had the meeting with product client. Summarised the meeting discussion into a
document. Worked on ER diagram for database. Everyone was assigned roles in
Monday's meeting. Made changes to the software architecture diagram. Began
writing answers to part C of the proposal. Met again on Wednesday. Discussed a
new implementation of the trade system, modelled after Steam's trading system.
Helped in making changes to the storyboard to accomodate these changes. Used
user stories from lectures to rewrite all our user stories.
