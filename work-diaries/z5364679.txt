Week 1

Our group was formed, and we named ourselves DUSM. I was selected 
as Scrum Master for our group. As a group, we discussed what areas
we're most comfortable with and what our main strengths are. From 
this we chose three projects and ordered them from the most preferable 
to least preferable to send to as our project preference. After
the lab was finished, I set up our Jira Site and finished the set-up
process as outlined by the documentation given on Moodle.


Week 2

We were notified that our project choice was ratified. From here
as a group we decided to brainstorm some ideas on our own and discuss
what to do from the lab. Greg was added to our group. We decided on 
using React for our frontend, Python for our backend with Flask, and 
PostgreSQL for our DB. Dyllanson was selected to be our Product Owner.

We started outlining what our end product could look like, what the 
stakeholders would want out of it and how to model the system as a 
whole. Started work on writing user stories and diagrams for our system.


Week 3

This week, we finished up our project proposal. We finilized our user
stories and overall story board for the UI layout of our web application.
Our stand-ups and meetings consisted of discussing the design and system
architecture of the web application. From this, we decided who would 
work on what component. At the beginning period of the development, I 
would be working on the front-end side of the project as the beginning 
will be front-end heavy.
